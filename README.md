# homebrew-custom

This tap contains custom formulae.

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap ffxblue/homebrew-custom` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install ffxblue/homebrew-custom/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffxblue/homebrew-custom/master/<formula>.rb
```
